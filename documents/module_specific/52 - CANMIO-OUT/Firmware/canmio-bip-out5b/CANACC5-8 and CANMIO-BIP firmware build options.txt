Build options for CANACC5-8.asm

This source can be built for 18F2480 or 18F25k80 PICs, for 4MHz or 16MHz resonator, and as CANACC5, CANACC8, CANMIO-OUT or CANBIP-out.

Set the PIC type in your MPLAB or MPLABX project properties.  

If you are using MPLABX, you can have different build confiurations within one project.

   PIC18F2480 builds by default with PLL on and 4MHz resonator
   PIC18F25k80 builds by default with PLL off and 16MHz resonator
   
(Note - internal processor clock speed is always 16MHz)
   
To override these defaults and force a build for 4Mhz or 16MHz resonator, set directive RES16M or RES4M in the project file/configuration

Set the module type as a directive in the project file (MPLAB) or project configuration (MPLABX) from one of the following:

CANACC5
CANACC8
CANMIO-OUT
CANBIP-OUT

Note that whilst you can build the CANMIO and CANBIP firmware for either PIC type and either resonator from this source, 
only the 25k80 16MHz resonator versions are uploaded to the wiki, the other versions may be supplied to members on request. 

This is to avoid cofusion from a plethora of different builds being available.
