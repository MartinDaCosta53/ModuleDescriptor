My notes on this say
Learn mode is required for testing on/off. NV37 is written 129 – 136 for test ON outputs 1 -8, 1 – 8 for test OFF outputs 1 – 8. Module detects this in learn mode and creates an internal event.
Finish button takes it out of learn mode, no further command sent.
So bit 7 selects ON end when set and bits 2:0 select the output.
