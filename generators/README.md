# generators
This folder contains scripts for some modules that will generate a module descriptor file for the appropriate module
A generator is useful where there is repeated information, e.g. the same content for channels 1 to 8, with tokens for simple substitution like variable number
It is recommended the script is run with the output to the 'output' folder - as this is folder is ignored by source control
e.g. ./generate_CANMIO.sh > output/CANMIO-0D20-9z.json
